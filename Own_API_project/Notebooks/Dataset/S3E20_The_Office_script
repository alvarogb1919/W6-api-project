280,54,I had no idea.,Andy
281,54,Then you did nothing wrong. We should go.,Jim
282,54,How could I not have realized?,Andy
283,54,She looks older.,Jim
284,54,"Yeah, she does, doesn't she?",Andy
285,54,No.,Jim
286,54,"She acts older, too. She knows everything about European history, and photosynthesis, and she made me this lanyard with, like, a Fimo clay thing. She's a real Renaissance woman.",Andy
287,54,Or a high school girl. Let's go [mouths 'wow' to the camera].,Jim
288,55,Chicken pot pie.,Andy
289,55,What's that?,Jim
290,55,"That's what I was eating, in the parking lot of a 7-Eleven for dinner. And I got out of the car to shake the crumbs off my shirt, and this smoking hot woman comes up and we strike up a conversation.",Andy
291,55,Oh. You don't have to tell me this.,Jim
292,55,She lets me buy her and her friends some wine coolers for a dinner party she's going to.,Andy
293,55,You shouldn't be talking about that.,Jim
294,55,"I threw in some scratch tickets, 'cause generous guy, and next thing you know we're making out in the woods.",Andy
295,55,Hypothetically. Hypothetically you were making out in the woods.,Jim
296,55,"No, we were really making out in the woods.",Andy
297,55,"No, can't help you now.",Jim
298,55,I gotta go talk to her.,Andy
299,55,No. D-,Jim
300,56,"With dissatisfied clients, it doesn't matter what you did. All they wanna hear is that you're sorry. They're like women that way. And this client is a woman. So when I say I'm sorry, it will be twice as effective.",Michael
301,57,So we're good?,Michael
302,57,"No, we're not.",Barbara Allen
303,57,I'm sorry.,Michael
304,57,"Well, okay. But I don't accept.",Barbara Allen
305,57,[whispering] Say you're sorry times infinity...,Dwight
306,57,Okay.,Michael
307,57,...'cause there's no comeback for that.,Dwight
308,57,All right. We are infinitely sorry.,Michael
309,57,I'm still furious.,Barbara Allen
310,57,You understand? You... you get this check.,Michael
311,57,Mmm.,Barbara Allen
312,58,Can I help you?,Spanish Teacher
313,58,"Yeah. I'm Mr. Bernard Johnson, MD. I'd like to talk with Jamie about a certain heart condition. Diagnosis: broken.",Andy
314,58,"Get out of here, Andy.",Jamie
315,58,Who's this guy?,Andy
316,58,My boyfriend.,Jamie
317,58,You're such a liar.,Andy
318,58,"Sir? You need to get out of here, before I call the police, okay?",Spanish Teacher
319,58,"Yeah, maybe you should call the police. See whose side they take. Warning, most cops are dudes.",Andy
320,58,"Dr. Johnson, we need you in surgery right away.",Jim
321,58,What?,Spanish Teacher
322,59,"I don't believe in apologies. When someone in the yakuza makes a mistake, they cut off a portion of their own pinky finger. And in that way, save face. And knowing the Japanese, they probably get an even better prosthetic finger. With a knife you can take out of it, or a screwdriver or a corkscrew.",Dwight
323,60,Why am I getting all of the bad ones?,Angela
324,60,Why can't you just say you're sorry and make them feel better?,Kelly
325,60,"I'm not gonna lie and say I'm sorry when the company didn't do anything wrong. That's immoral, and this is ridiculous.",Angela
326,60,"Would you, please? Please.",Oscar
327,60,"Well, you have to do what I say, okay? Because Michael put me in charge, even though you're old enough to be my mother.",Kelly
328,60,"What? Well what you say is stupid, and your job is pointless. And you're a slut and everyone thinks so.",Angela
329,60,"Well, you're fired, okay? Go back to accounting, Angela.",Kelly
330,60,Gladly. I quit.,Angela
331,61,"If cartoon characters didn't have sex, then how would we get new cartoon characters? From the sex! [giggles]",Kevin
332,62,The customer is always right. Mrs. Allen was our customer. She was wrong. Is that a contradiction? No. Because she's not our customer anymore.,Michael
333,63,Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos. My favorite is the one for his mother.,Pam
334,64,"Hey, Mom. Happy birthday, belatedly. Sorry I forgot. I had put it on my calendar and Pam threw that out.",Michael
335,65,My personal favorite is the one he made for his condo association.,Pam
336,66,"And without denying the seriousness of the situation, I would just like to remind you that in much of the Netherlands, swimming naked is the norm. So in Norway, you'd be the weirdos.",Michael
337,67,"Okay, Andy, we need to go. Seriously.",Jim
338,67,"Dude, there she is. Don't look, don't look. She's sitting with Denise. How am I supposed to do this? Denise hates me.",Andy
339,67,Don't do it.,Jim
340,67,"What is your problem, man? Can't you support a bro? That's why you don't have any friends, Tuna. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just, I need...",Andy
341,67,That's okay.,Jim
342,67,...your help. I love her.,Andy
343,67,What?,Jim
344,67,"Yeah. I lo- I love her. Is this what love is?  This, like, horrible feeling in my stomach?",Andy
345,67,"No, that's your conscience. Listen to it.",Jim
346,67,"Look, okay, just be my wingman. Beer me five minutes. Talk to Denise. She's really into White Russians and whippets.",Andy
347,68,"Jamie, can I talk to you for a second?",Andy
348,68,Yeah. I only have a minute.,Jamie
349,68,"[sits down next to Denise] So, high school.",Jim
350,68,Do you have a cigarette?,Denise
351,68,"Oh, I don't smoke. Sorry.",Jim
352,68,There's nothing to do in this town.,Denise
353,68,You should take up a musical instrument.,Jim
354,68,"Yeah, I should take up that. Jamie?",Denise
355,68,"Hey, uh, does Mr. Nortman still teach here? He's a jerk, right?",Jim
356,68,"He's dead. Hey, do you have any weed?",Denise
357,68,"No, nope. What else? What else? You watch The Hills? What is Heidi thinking?",Jim
358,68,How old are you?,Denise
359,68,How old do you think I am?,Jim
360,68,Forty?,Denise
361,68,[shakes head],Jim
362,68,Are you someone's dad here?,Denise
363,68,Not that I know of.,Jim
364,68,Ew. What kind of car do you have?,Denise
365,68,I drive a Saab station wagon.,Jim
366,68,My dad just gave me his old Lexus.,Denise
367,68,"Really? Way to earn it. Hey, Andy?",Jim
368,68,What?,Andy
369,68,Yup.,Jim
370,69,Very well [hangs up phone]. I just got a call from Debbie Brown over at the mill. She claims innocence and is willing to come over here and defend herself.,Dwight
371,69,"No time. Dwight, I love Debbie Brown. She's a close personal friend. But quality is my life. This company has a reputation to uphold. As much as it pains me, someone has to be held accountable.",Creed
372,69,You're right. Mercy is for girl-babies. Time to put this dog down.,Dwight
373,70,Are we ready?,Michael
374,70,Final touch-ups.,Dwight
375,70,Okay. Am I shiny?,Michael
376,70,Yeah.,Dwight
377,70,"Okay. We good? Okay, that's enough Aqua Net.",Michael
378,70,I don't know...,Dwight
379,70,[clears throat] Stop it.,Michael
380,70,[coughs],Dwight
381,71,"Hey, Angela. I'm sorry that I said you were old enough to be my mother. I don't know why I said that. I think I might be hypoglycemic or something, but still, it's no excuse. So, I'm very sorry.",Kelly
382,71,"Oh. Thank you, Kelly [long pause]. And I wish I hadn't called you stupid.",Angela
383,71,Do you think I'm a slut?,Kelly
384,71,"No, but some of your outfits are not appr-",Angela
385,71,Apology accepted! [hugs Angela],Kelly
386,71,I didn't apologize.,Angela
387,71,We're like best friends now!,Kelly
388,71,We're not.,Angela
389,71,I'll text you!,Kelly
390,71,Don't!,Angela
391,71,"Bye, Angela!",Kelly
392,71,Fine.,Angela
393,72,"That is all I was looking for today. She got something out of my training session. I mean, she will never work in customer relations. Oh, my God, no. Never. But maybe she'll be less of a grump.",Kelly
394,73,Kelly's not so bad. She really taught me something today [rolls eyes].,Angela
395,74,"I have literally apologized an infinite number of times on this, and there are still calls for me to resign. Calls from an annoying woman, and possibly even the media alike. Well let me tell you something, something from the heart. I will not resign. I need this job. My mortgage is hundreds of dollars a month. With this job, I can barely cover that. I have a company car, but I still have to pay for gas, and gas prices are high. And I have no savings whatsoever. And it wasn't even me. It's so not fair that they want me to resign.",Michael
396,75,"...to the fullest extent of the law [hangs up phone]. Listen up, everyone! I just got off the phone with the mill.  Final responsibility for Watermark-gate has been assigned. Floor manager Debbie Brown has officially been terminated. Lets give a big hand to Creed Bratton, without whose earnest and diligent sleuthing this scandal might never have been resolved [claps].",Dwight
397,75,"Just doing my job, guys.",Creed
